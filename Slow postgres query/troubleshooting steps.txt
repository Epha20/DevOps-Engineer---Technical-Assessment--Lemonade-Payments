I always start checking with resource utilization like CPU, memory and storage cause Lack of resources can really affect query execution. Next thing I do is discuss with my team if they are running massive queries that can slow down execution of the server, if so I suggest ways to optimize their queries and tune the db. sometimes I also encounter lock issues and I launch a clean up activity to remove lock tables and finish runs one by one.
